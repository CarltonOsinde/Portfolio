          I worked with the Development team on the <strong>end to end 
          development of an error-tracking feature</strong> for the Score Board. 
          I had the pleasure of spliting my time with the Governance team to assist 
          in <strong>partnership talks with Adidas</strong> and learned what goes into market research
          on successful NCAA National Championship trends that could be implemented into the 
          <strong> 2019 National Championship season.</strong> In addition I <strong>collaborated with senior engineers </strong> 
          to understand best practices for <strong>writing production code and test cases</strong>.

                    Over the course of 4-months I would have the opportuity to collaborate, design, develop and test a feature that

                    I was able to work alongside senior engineers to develop a feature that run through 5+ years worth of National Championship data 
                    and extracted and stored into a <strong>SQL databases each university's primary key identifier within the XML files.</strong> We segregarted each 
                    university storing their identifier and their variations.
                    
                    Thereafter we implemented a data pipeline that intergrated the identified variations database to the stream of data being uploaded
                    where<strong> I created a script to read the incoming data and trigger a warning whenever a corrupted file was uploaded </strong>. It would then check the 
                    variation database for a match and replace it with the correct primary key identifier.

                    Overall this was a great learning experience I learned how to 
                    develop a pipeline, how to contribute during design and analysis 
                    meetings. development and how to deliver technical presentations 
                    to my team. Also, it was great to be part of such a large coorporation
                    and see how my teams work contributed to the grander vision.
