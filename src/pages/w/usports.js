          I worked with the Development team on the <strong>end to end 
          development of an error-tracking feature</strong> for the Score Board. 
          I had the pleasure of spliting my time with the Governance team to assist 
          in <strong>partnership talks with Adidas</strong> and learned what goes into market research
          on successful NCAA National Championship trends that could be implemented into the 
          <strong> 2019 National Championship season.</strong> In addition I <strong>collaborated with senior engineers </strong> 
          to understand best practices for <strong>writing production code and test cases</strong>.

                    I had four-months to deliver a fully function data pipeline that would be

                    Over the course 4-months I would have the opportuity to solidfy my understanding

                    Alteryx and Python scripting. My goal was to {" "}

                    During this time I had to implement various solutions using the three technologys

                    I was able to successfully develope a data pipeline to extract up to<strong> 40,000 records
                    of currency rate data and transform it into 30 columns </strong>with accurate formula application
                     using Python-Pandas. In addition I was able to create a  script that saw a time savings 
                     on documenting workflow automation. I leveraged on <strong>Object-Oriented programming principles</strong>
                    to ensure the script applied to different team templates.

                    Overall this was a great learning experience I learned how to 
                    develop a pipeline, how to contribute during design and analysis 
                    meetings. development and how to deliver technical presentations 
                    to my team. Also, it was great to be part of such a large coorporation
                    and see how my teams work contributed to the grander vision.
